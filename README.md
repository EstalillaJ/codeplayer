# codeplayer
Code Player is way to test and run html, css, and javascript in the browser instantly.

I built Code Player as a project from the Udemy [Complete Web Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/#/).
A decent amount of the code/idea belongs to [Rob Percieval](https://www.udemy.com/u/robpercival/), the teacher of the course.
